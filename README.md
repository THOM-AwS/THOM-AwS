### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<strong><b>First I drink the Coffee, then I do the things.</b></strong>

1. If it's not in git, it doesnâ€™t go in a compute instance, account or a piece of infrastructure.
  - Git is the single source of truth and contains a complete history of all code changes.
  - A complete audit trail
  - Non repudiation
  - Everything is code
2. Changes are to be run through pipelines
  - Everything is automated
4. Every change is to be subject to a proper peer review by a person who is capable of understanding the subject matter
5. Diffs are not permitted between Production and its proceeding environment (non prod/preprod)
  - Test everything before production release
  - Everyone has a test account, we separate ours from the production account
  - We start in a test account
6. No changes or write access to production without a very good reason
  - No humans in production
7. Secure run
  - Everything gets patched
  - Everything gets backups
  - Everything gets monitoring. Critical items get alerting, you must be alerted if something is broken
8. Documentation, You need to document what you have created and how it works so that it can be repaired or replaced in 10 years.
